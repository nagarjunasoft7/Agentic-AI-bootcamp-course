    "    Tuples: are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after the tuple is created.\n",

    "    Lists: are defined using square brackets [].\n",
    "    Tuples: are defined using parentheses ().\n",

    "Performance:\n",
    "    Tuples: are generally more memory-efficient and faster than lists for operations like iteration and access, primarily because their fixed size allows for optimizations.\n",
    "    Lists, due to their mutability and dynamic sizing, can be less performant in scenarios where immutability would be beneficial.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "    Lists: are suitable when you need a collection of items that will be frequently modified, such as adding or removing elements.\n",
    "    Tuples: are ideal for storing fixed collections of related data, such as coordinates, database records, or function return values, where data integrity is important.\n",
